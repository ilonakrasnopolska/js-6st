# Family Todo List App

This application is a to-do list for family members - designed for you, your mom, and dad. It's developed using JavaScript and the Bootstrap library to create a user-friendly interface.

## Description

The app utilizes local storage to save the to-do list for each family member. Each family member has their own separate list and array of objects.

### Functionality

- **Input and Add Button:** Entering text creates a new item in the to-do list.
- **List Item Elements:** Each list item contains an index, text content, and "done" and "delete" buttons.
- **"Done" Marking:** Clicking the "done" button changes the card color to green, toggles the boolean value from false to true in the object, and updates it in the local storage.
- **Deleting an Item:** Clicking the "delete" button removes the item from the list, the object array, and local storage.

## Usage

To run the application locally, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
